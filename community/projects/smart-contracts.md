# Smart Contracts

The Application functionality ( the dApp) part of Codo comes in the form of the Web application and the Smart Contracts that accompany the Project. For each sub-application there is an accompanying Smart Contract that has to be deployed to an Ethereum compatible Blockchain. The smart contracts are based on OpenZeppelin and try to adhere to Open Standards such that existing Projects can start using the Web Apps without the need for deploying new contracts. The exeption is the core Codo Project conctract including the planner and Task Management that has to be deployed for all projects. The contracts are summarized below.



| Contract | Application | Creator/maintainer | Auditor | Required? |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ------- | --------- |
| Project  | Planner     |                    |         |           |
|          |             |                    |         |           |
|          |             |                    |         |           |
