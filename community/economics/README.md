While the Codo Community is set up as A non profit Organisation (more specifically a Wyoming DUNA) there is a financial model around fee collection. In short:

* Every Task that is being accomplished on Codo is subject to a low fee (currently 4.5 %).
* Fees are collected via the Project Smart Contract

Codo's Income is distributed to the Codo Project's contributors, the Governance participants and to the larger Community by way of **Grants**. A fraction is also retained for the operation of the Project.
