# Quick start

Codo is about Contributors and Projects and "The Flow" (our opinionated way-of-working for Projects and Remote teams).

What can I do on the platform?

You can as a Contributor:

* create a profile and enter information on you skill set
* start searching for projects requiring your expertise (or use matchmaking functionality)
* apply to start working on a Task
* get payed in Tokens or Crypto

You can also:

* start your own Project (or ask to join)
* use the Planner App to break down the project into manageable Tasks which others can Apply to
* make a Crowd Fund to raise money
* search for and reach out to individuals who you think could be a likely fit for the Team
