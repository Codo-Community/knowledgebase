# Introduction

Welcome to the Codo Community Pages! We are honored to have you here. These pages describe what Codo is about and why (we believe) it is important to you, us and anyone who is looking to get more freedom and power over their Professional Lives (which also in-turn should have implications for Society at large). For the hands-on quickstart of how to get going using Codo please go here. For the more ambitious reader, we begin with a little more philosophical expos√® ...

### Working life ...

Working life, as we all know, is not a straight up easy process. Chances are that you go through life, getting some type of education then finding some job (mostly by chance) and in that or subsequent jobs spend your time (your Professional Life) selling away your work and time to some larger Company or Organisation. This is still true for most people as of 2024. Now, however, all this is about to change.

Along with Blockchain and Web3 comes a mind shift and a new opportunity to build societal systems firmly rooted in a set of core values rather than ones built solely on necessity. Maintaining this long term invariably requires doing a bunch of hard work like: not cutting corners, having open and transparent decision processes which are codified and verifiable and communicating (and reiterating) the core values. Without this work we stand the risk of falling into the necessity trap and redoing the failures of the past. In other words, when we have food on the table, we have the over-capacity to sit down and think about how we want things to really work, rather than be subjected to the necessities or the harsh reality of life. This is a big opportunity. With a little thinking about how society should function rooted in some clear principles coupled with the technology to have those principles directly be codified into a suite (or smorgasbord) of verifiable rule sets we can now make that society happen.

technology to create a more free and open Society. A society that is not about competition but which focuses on collaboration and openness. This really is as close to a free lunch as we can get.

### But AI ...

AI makes this . AI opens up to the door to this unexplored and vast universe of stuff that we can work on and do but that, until now, was of reach due to time or other constraints. We believe AI is a great tool to move things forward more quickly. But AI used incorrectly shifts away even more power from the many to the very few. This is why we need to develop new ways of working with an emphasis on the value of the individual where also the larger collective of humans on this planet can share in the successes this new technology .
