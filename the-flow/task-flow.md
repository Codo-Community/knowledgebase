# Task Flow

The center piece of The Flow is the Task. A Task is the smallest piece of work in a Project and the main way that work is being tracked. It is also the way in which financial transactions and compensation is being transferred from Projects to Contributors. A task goes through a set of states, some of which are stored in the Project's decentralized database and some of which are stored in the Task smart contract on the Blockchain. One of the main functions of the Task (once it is has been added to the Blockchain) is to **act as an Escrow** for the Contributor Compensation. The Compensation sum is stored in the Smart Contract and can be withdrawn by neither the Contributor nor the Task Creator until the Review process has passed with a Passing score. More on that in the [Review Process](review-process.md).

### Task States

Tasks are initially created in your local browser, then moved to the Project's ComposeDB database on Ceramic and then upon acceptance of a Contributor that should work on the Task . As Task state management is handed over to the Blockchain all subsequent changes need to be added as Blockchain (Ethereum) transactions.

| State | Transaction? | Stored |
| ----- | ------------ | ------ |
|       |              |        |
|       |              |        |
|       |              |        |
